I happened to see a demo img of *'Binding of Isaac: Repentance'* in [SerpentAI](https://github.com/SerpentAI/SerpentAI) and resolved to give it a try.

Thanks to [Serpent.AI](https://www.youtube.com/@SerpentAI)'s live video for giving me a way to learn how to use it.

## The results are shown below:

Isaac Heart Chart:

The results of the final try, while you can see that the model is moving in a good direction, are slightly clumsy in practice, and even a bit of a lying flat, but seeing that no one has uploaded them before, I decided to post the results of this try for reference.
